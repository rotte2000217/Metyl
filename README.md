> :rocket: A college project written with ASP.Net core, React and Nextjs

## Quick start

```bash

$ docker-compose up

```

By default, the ecommerce site locates at port 3000. Open http://localhost:3000 to get started!

## WebBanHang

This is the backend service of the whole application, it was written with ASP.Net core 3.1, EF core

I'm gonna fix some issues and refactor the codebase, maybe try using DDD architecture :wink:.

## shop-rest-admin

This is the CMS client, written in React, which is the whole mess, I'm not gonna touch it!

## nextjs-metyl

Ecommerce site, written with Nextjs, the reason I chose Nexjs is for SEO purpose. React, as well as other frontend framework/library is suck at SEO, so we need SSR for things like Ecommerce site. Nextjs is pretty good at SEO.
